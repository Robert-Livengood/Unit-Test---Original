# Unit-Test---Original
This is the CS330 Final Project prior to adding my enhancements that were outilined in my example code reivew. 
The code review can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pwx_MJLvxNQ).

This artifact is from the CS 405 Module 4 assignment. Itâ€™s purpose was to demonstrate unit testing by providing a few 
examples and then having us create some of our own unit tests using the JUnit API. This assignment is originally from June, 2022.
